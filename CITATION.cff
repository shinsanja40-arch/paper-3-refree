abstract: >
  This repository contains the implementation and experimental data for a novel
  knowledge refinement framework that reinterprets Cartesian skepticism from an
  engineering perspective to address hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs).
  The system achieves <1% hallucination rate through a three-tier persona architecture
  with asynchronous reset mechanisms.
